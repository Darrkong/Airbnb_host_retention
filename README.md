# Airbnb Host Retention

This project predicts AirBnb host churn.  AirBnb hosts lists short term rentals for business or leisure travelers on the platform.  However, hosts list their living spaces on a voluntart basis and may discontinue at any time.  It may be helpful to proactively identify which hosts are likely to discontinue hosting in the next year as these hosts may require additional support or outreach to continue using the platform.  

[InsideAirBnb] (http://insideairbnb.com/index.html) scrapes data for all AirBnb listings on a yearly basis for selected cities.  For this project, we are looking specifically at Los Angeles listings in 2017.  Listings that appear in Los Angeles during the 2017 scrape, but do not appear in the 2018 scrape are considered to be discontinued.  Data from InsideAirBnb associated with the listing as well as outside sources may provide additional predictors.
